# Active Directory Home Lab Project

This repository contains resources, guides, and configuration files to set up an Active Directory-based home lab environment. The project simulates real-world scenarios for both Blue Team (defensive security) and Red Team (offensive security) practices using tools like Splunk, Sysmon, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team.

---

## **1. Overview**

The project covers:
- Setting up Active Directory on a Windows Server and promoting it to a domain controller.
- Configuring Splunk for monitoring and telemetry.
- Installing and configuring Sysmon for detailed event logging.
- Simulating attacks with Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team.
- Troubleshooting common issues.
